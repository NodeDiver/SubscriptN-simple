# SubscriptN Development Log

## Purpose
This file serves as a comprehensive development diary for the SubscriptN project. It tracks every user prompt, code change, and modification made during development sessions. The goal is to maintain complete continuity between work sessions, allowing any developer (including AI assistants) to quickly understand the project's current state and history.

## Instructions for AI Assistant
**When starting a new session, ALWAYS read this file first to understand the project context and current state.**

### Daily Maintenance Instructions
1. **At the start of each session**: Read this entire file to understand project context
2. **For every user prompt**: Add a new entry under the current session with:
   - User's exact request/prompt

## Project Context (as of 2025-07-05)

### Current State
- **Project**: SubscriptN - Bitcoin subscription management platform
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: SQLite with role-based user system
- **Authentication**: Session-based with provider/shop_owner roles
- **Integration**: ZapPlanner webhooks (currently implemented)
- **Goal**: Enable automated Bitcoin subscriptions via NWC

### Key Insight from Previous Session (2025-07-04)
> "I realized today that with this rest-call to zapplanner I am actually not really implementing nwc. I should re-focus and think of implementing perhaps a nwc conection somwhere and let the webapp do the subscription instead of asking the user to go to zapplanner with the click of the button add new shop button."

### Demo Credentials
- **Provider**: `btcpayserver` / `btcpayserver`
- **Shop Owner**: `shopowner` / `shopowner`

### Completed Features
- ✅ Authentication system with role-based access
- ✅ Database structure (users, servers, shops, subscriptions)
- ✅ API routes for all CRUD operations
- ✅ UI dashboards for both user roles
- ✅ ZapPlanner webhook integration
- ✅ Security audit and validation

### Pending Work
- 🔄 Polish half-implemented features
- 🔄 Finalize UI flows
- 🔄 Validate end-to-end subscription functionality
- 🔄 Consider NWC integration to replace ZapPlanner dependency
