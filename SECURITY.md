# Security Documentation

## üîí Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in SubscriptN and guidelines for maintaining security.

## ‚úÖ Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- Unified user model (no roles)
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Protected routes with authentication checks

### Data Protection
- SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Secure session management

### Environment Security
- Environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Database files excluded from version control
- No hardcoded secrets in source code

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist for Production

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Generate strong session secrets
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Set up proper environment variables
- [ ] Remove demo users or change credentials
- [ ] Review and update API keys
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Set up proper logging

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Required for production
BTCPAY_HOST=https://your-btcpay-server.com
BTCPAY_API_KEY=your_secure_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_session_secret

# Optional (for development)
DEMO_USERNAME=your_demo_username
DEMO_PASSWORD=your_demo_password
```

## üö® Security Considerations

### Database Security
- SQLite database files are excluded from version control
- Database contains sensitive user data and API keys
- Ensure proper file permissions on database files
- Regular backups with encryption

### API Security
- All API endpoints require authentication
- All data/actions are scoped to the authenticated user
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

### Webhook Security
- Webhook endpoints should be secured in production
- Validate webhook signatures if provided by ZapPlanner
- Implement proper error handling

## üîç Security Audit Results

### Code Analysis
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets found
- ‚úÖ No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ No XSS vulnerabilities detected
- ‚úÖ Proper input validation implemented
- ‚úÖ Secure authentication flow

### Files Excluded from Version Control
- `.env*` files (environment variables)
- `*.db` files (database files)
- `*.log` files (log files)
- `*.key`, `*.pem` files (certificates/keys)

## üöÄ Deployment Security

### Production Checklist
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Use production-grade database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
   - Set up proper SSL/TLS certificates
   - Configure secure headers

2. **Authentication**
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use secure cookie settings
   - Enable CSRF protection

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up security logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Regular security audits

## üìû Security Contact

For security issues or questions:
- Review this documentation
- Check the codebase for security patterns
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set

## üîÑ Regular Security Tasks

- [ ] Monthly dependency updates
- [ ] Quarterly security audits
- [ ] Annual penetration testing
- [ ] Regular backup verification
- [ ] Monitor security advisories 

### User Model Update
- As of 2025-07-08, all user data and actions are strictly scoped to the authenticated user. There are no longer multiple user roles; all users can access all dashboards, but only see and manage their own data.
